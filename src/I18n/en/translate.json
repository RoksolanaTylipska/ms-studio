In some cases, the procedure can be performed earlier, but only with written parental or guardian consent. <br /><br/> <strong>Sugaring and Wax Depilation:</strong> Regular procedures can start from the age of 12-14. If unwanted hair appears early and causes psychological discomfort, the procedure can be done earlier, with parental consent.",
      "question5": "Which device do you use?",
      "answer5": "We use the modern European diode laser Alvi Prague DL-7000, 2024 model. This device ensures effective and safe hair removal thanks to advanced technology and high power. Its innovative cooling system guarantees comfort during the procedure, and its settings allow adaptation to different skin and hair types. This device features a short pulse – 20 joules in 25 ms! This is the optimal flash duration for effective hair removal while ensuring skin safety.",
      "question6": "Does laser hair removal remove ingrown hairs?",
      "answer6": "Laser hair removal can help reduce the number of ingrown hairs, as it affects the hair follicle, destroying it and decreasing the likelihood of hair growing inward in the future."
